# Cloud

### [What is the cloud?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/)

The cloud is, at it's very core, a group of computers that you cannot touch or see personally, but that you can virtually interact with, run software on and work with how you wish.

### Why the cloud?

The cloud is an appealing option for software developers and devops engineers for deploying applications for many reasons:

- centralized and accessible control for all involved
- no need to maintain physical servers and the related components that fail from time to time
- ability to distribute workload and resources worldwide
- resilient services, data storage, networking and monitoring
- and more!
